# HeadoutHack

The idea of the hack is to develop a webapp & android app for making it ease for new travellers to efficiently make the best use of all events around him using Headout.

# How it Works?

1. The system scraps Headout events data and tags them
2. Once the user selects a city, he is asked to input his interests and time availbility.
3. The system does combination of all events available near him and finds the best combination with shortest trip distance and time efficiency.
4. As the user checks out the best combination, he is shown the directions & traffic information on Maps and then is proceeded to checkout through Headout.
